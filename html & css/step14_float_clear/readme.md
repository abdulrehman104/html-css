# Float in css
In CSS, the `float` property is used to specify how an element should float within its containing element. When an element is floated, it's taken out of the normal flow of the document and positioned to the left or right within its container. This allows other elements to wrap around it.

Here's a breakdown of what the `float` property does:

1. **Float Left**: When an element is floated to the left (`float: left;`), it moves to the left-most available position within its containing element, and subsequent content will flow around its right side.

2. **Float Right**: Conversely, when an element is floated to the right (`float: right;`), it moves to the right-most available position within its containing element, and subsequent content will flow around its left side.

Here's a simple example:

``` css
.float-left {
    float: left;
}

.float-right {
    float: right;
}
```

In this example, elements with the class `.float-left` will be floated to the left, while elements with the class `.float-right` will be floated to the right.

Floating elements can be useful for creating layouts where content wraps around images or for creating multi-column layouts. However, it's important to be cautious when using floats, as they can affect the layout and positioning of other elements on the page. Additionally, clearing floats may be necessary to ensure that subsequent content displays as intended.

# Clear in css
The `clear` property in CSS is used to control the behavior of an element in relation to floated elements. When an element is cleared, it will not wrap around any floated elements that appear before it in the HTML markup. This property is commonly used to ensure that an element starts below any floated elements that precede it.

Here's how you can use the `clear` property in CSS:

```css
.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}
```

In this example, the `.clearfix` class is used to create a clearfix, which is a commonly used technique to clear floats. The `::after` pseudo-element is used to insert a clearing element after the content of the `.clearfix` element. The `clear: both;` property ensures that the element is positioned below any floated elements.

You can apply the `.clearfix` class to HTML elements like this:

```html
<div class="float-left">Float left</div>
<div class="float-right">Float right</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<div>This content will start below the floated elements.</div>
```

This ensures that the content following the floated elements starts below them, rather than wrapping around them.
