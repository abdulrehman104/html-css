# CSS Media Queries

Media queries help to add responsiveness to the website by adding breakout points or when only a certain condition is true.

Eg:

![Media Queries](css%20media%20queries.webp)

Output:

![Media Output](media%20queries%20output.webp)

The output of this code would change when the dimension would be 800px.

![Media Output](condition%20true%20output.webp)
